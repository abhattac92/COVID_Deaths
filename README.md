# Kickstarter Campaigns

Creating a Machine Learning model to predict kickstarter campaign success and display data on an interactive dashboard

# Circle - Database

We have created an RDS through AWS and PGadmin PostregSQL. The data is stored on the AWS platform. We created a Spark session so we could use pySpark. We then read the data from AWS S3. We then configured the settings for RDS. A table was created in PGadmin that had all the same columns as our database. We then copied the dataframe into our RDS.
